# A2C Method Baseline with OpenAI Gym

This project implements the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) method as a baseline for reinforcement learning tasks using the OpenAI Gym environment. A2C is an on-policy algorithm that combines elements of policy gradient methods and value function approximation.

## Introduction

The A2C algorithm is a popular reinforcement learning method that uses both actor (policy) and critic (value function) networks to learn policies in environments with discrete or continuous action spaces. This project provides a baseline implementation of A2C using OpenAI Gym environments for easy experimentation and benchmarking.

## Implementation

The implementation includes the following components:

- **Actor Network**: Defines the policy network that outputs actions based on the current state.
- **Critic Network**: Defines the value function network that estimates the state value (or advantage) function.
- **A2C Agent**: Implements the A2C algorithm, including policy and value function updates based on sampled trajectories.
- **Training Loop**: Runs the training process, where the agent interacts with the environment, collects trajectories, and updates its networks based on the collected data.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained agent's performance by running episodes in the environment and measuring performance metrics such as average reward or episode length.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for neural network implementation)

## Usage

1. Define your environment in OpenAI Gym or use one of the existing environments.
2. Implement the actor and critic networks using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. Implement the A2C agent that interacts with the environment, collects data, and updates its networks.
4. Train the A2C agent using the training loop and evaluate its performance on the environment.
5. Tune hyperparameters and experiment with different network architectures to improve performance.

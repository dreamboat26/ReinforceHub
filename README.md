Follow the steps below to set up Acme components manually:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have access to a GPU runtime, as the last cell of the provided code requires it.
- Set up the Colab environment with GPU runtime selected: **Runtime > Change runtime type > Select GPU**.

### Environment Setup
- Set the MuJoCo rendering mode: `%env MUJOCO_GL=egl`.
- Import necessary libraries and modules:

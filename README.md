# Introduction to Q-Learning

Q-Learning serves as the foundation for deep reinforcement learning, providing a framework for agents to learn optimal actions in an environment. It involves several key components:

- **Agent**: The entity interacting with the environment by taking actions to maximize rewards.
- **Environment**: The universe in which the agent operates, with states that change based on the agent's actions.
- **Actions**: Steps the agent can take to influence the environment.
- **Step**: An action taken by the agent resulting in a change of environment state.
- **Episode**: A sequence of steps ending in a terminal state.
- **Epoch**: A training iteration consisting of multiple episodes.
- **Terminal State**: A state where further actions are not meaningful, often indicating success or failure.

Q-Learning builds a table suggesting actions for each possible state. However, it faces challenges with continuous state and action spaces. Deep reinforcement learning addresses these challenges using neural networks.

## Introducing the Mountain Car

The Mountain Car environment requires a car to climb a steep hill using limited engine power. Q-Learning can solve this problem by learning to utilize potential energy effectively.

## Reinforcement Learning

Q-Learning employs rewards to guide agents towards successful states. The algorithm updates Q-values representing the expected rewards for state-action pairs. Learning occurs through episodes, adjusting Q-values based on received rewards.

## Q-Learning Car

We'll implement a self-driving car using Q-Learning. Several hyperparameters play vital roles:

- **Learning Rate**: Controls the rate of Q-value updates.
- **Discount Factor**: Weighs future rewards against immediate rewards.
- **Episodes**: Number of training iterations.
- **Epsilon (Exploration Rate)**: Probability of selecting random actions.

## Inspecting the Q-Table

We can analyze the Q-table to understand the agent's actions for each state. It reveals patterns in action choices based on position and velocity.

## Conclusion

Q-Learning provides a fundamental approach to reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn optimal behavior in complex environments. Understanding its principles is crucial for building more advanced reinforcement learning systems.

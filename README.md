## Reinforcement Learning with Atari Breakout

This tutorial focuses on Reinforcement Learning, specifically in the context of Atari games from the 1970-80's, using the game Breakout as an example. In Reinforcement Learning, an agent learns to navigate an environment through trial and error, with only access to the game screen and feedback on its actions' outcomes.

### Introduction

Reinforcement Learning poses a challenging problem in AI as the agent must learn to interpret game screen features and associate them with its actions' consequences, including future rewards or penalties. The seminal work on solving this problem was done by researchers at Google DeepMind, with this tutorial drawing heavily from their early research papers.

### Approach

The agent estimates Q-values based on the game screen, indicating the likelihood of each action leading to the highest future reward. This problem is tackled by training a function approximator to store and retrieve these Q-values. While the original DeepMind algorithm was complex, this tutorial simplifies it while retaining stability during training.

### Key Concepts

1. **Q-values**: Estimated values indicating the potential cumulative reward for each action in the future.
2. **Function Approximator**: Used to store and retrieve Q-values based on game screen inputs.
3. **Atari Breakout**: The specific game environment used for demonstration.

### Implementation

The implementation of Reinforcement Learning in Atari Breakout involves several steps, including preprocessing game screens, training the agent to estimate Q-values, and optimizing its performance through various techniques.

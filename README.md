# Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Vertex AI

This tutorial demonstrates how to use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on Vertex AI to tune a large language model (LLM). RLHF leverages feedback gathered from humans to improve the accuracy of the model.

## Objective

The main objective of this tutorial is to utilize Vertex AI RLHF to tune and deploy a large language model model. Key steps include setting the number of model tuning steps, creating a Vertex AI Pipeline job using a predefined tuning template, executing the pipeline using Vertex AI Pipelines, and getting predictions from the tuned model.

## Understanding the Role of Datasets in RLHF

The success of RLHF relies heavily on the quality and structure of the datasets used for training. Two primary datasets play a crucial role in this process:

1. **Prompt Dataset:**
   - Contains a collection of prompts or inputs presented to the language model.
   - Prompts should be diverse, representative of the target task or domain, and cover a wide range of scenarios and user intents.

2. **Preference Dataset:**
   - Consists of pairs of responses generated by the language model for the prompts in the prompt dataset.
   - Each pair is accompanied by human judgments indicating which response is preferred or considered of higher quality.

## Best Practices

Consider the following best practices when working with `preference_dataset` and `prompt_dataset` for RLHF training:

### Data Quality:
- Ensure both datasets are:
  - Clean: Free from errors, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information.
  - Consistent: Follow a uniform format and adhere to the specified structure.
  - Relevant: Aligned with the intended task and target audience.
- Include a wide range of examples and use cases in both datasets to improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

### Data Labeling:
- Ensure labels accurately reflect the quality of responses in the prompt dataset.
- Use clear and consistent criteria for labeling to avoid ambiguity and bias.

### Dataset Size and Balance:
- Ensure the preference_dataset has a balanced distribution of classes or preferences.
- The size of datasets should be adequate for the complexity of the task and the size of the model.
  - Start with around 5,000-10,000 samples for reward model training (preference_dataset) and increase if needed.
  - Start with hundreds or a few thousand samples for RLHF tuning (prompt_dataset) and adjust based on performance.

Experimentation is key to finding the optimal dataset size for your use case.

## Training a DQN Agent on Cartpole with TF-Agents

This example demonstrates how to train a DQN (Deep Q Networks) agent on the Cartpole environment using the TF-Agents library.

### Overview

TF-Agents is a library for reinforcement learning in TensorFlow. It provides the tools to implement various reinforcement learning algorithms, including DQN, and train agents to solve different environments.

### Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have TensorFlow and TF-Agents installed. You can install them via pip:

2. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, TF-Agents, and Gym.

3. **Define Environment**: Define the Cartpole environment using Gym.

4. **Initialize DQN Agent**: Initialize the DQN agent with the required parameters, such as the Q-network architecture and optimizer.

5. **Define Training Loop**: Implement the training loop to interact with the environment, collect experience, and train the agent using the collected data.

6. **Train Agent**: Train the DQN agent on the Cartpole environment by running the training loop for a certain number of episodes or until convergence.

7. **Evaluate Agent**: Evaluate the trained agent by running it in the environment and observing its performance.

### Usage

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tf_agents.environments import suite_gym
from tf_agents.networks import q_network
from tf_agents.agents.dqn import dqn_agent
from tf_agents.utils import common

# Define Cartpole environment
env = suite_gym.load('CartPole-v0')

# Define Q-network
fc_layer_params = (100,)
q_net = q_network.QNetwork(
 env.observation_spec(),
 env.action_spec(),
 fc_layer_params=fc_layer_params)

# Initialize DQN agent
optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=1e-3)
train_step_counter = tf.Variable(0)
agent = dqn_agent.DqnAgent(
 env.time_step_spec(),
 env.action_spec(),
 q_network=q_net,
 optimizer=optimizer,
 td_errors_loss_fn=common.element_wise_squared_loss,
 train_step_counter=train_step_counter)

agent.initialize()

# Define training parameters
num_iterations = 20000
collect_steps_per_iteration = 1
batch_size = 64
collect_episodes_per_iteration = 2

# Define replay buffer and data collection
replay_buffer = tf_uniform_replay_buffer.TFUniformReplayBuffer(
 data_spec=agent.collect_data_spec,
 batch_size=env.batch_size,
 max_length=1000000)

collect_data_spec = tf_agents.trajectories.time_step_spec(env.observation_spec())
collect_policy = agent.collect_policy
collect_driver = dynamic_episode_driver.DynamicEpisodeDriver(
 env, collect_policy, observers=[replay_buffer.add_batch], num_episodes=collect_episodes_per_iteration)

# Define dataset for training
dataset = replay_buffer.as_dataset(
 num_parallel_calls=3, 
 sample_batch_size=batch_size, 
 num_steps=2).prefetch(3)

iterator = iter(dataset)

# Training loop
for _ in range(num_iterations):
 # Collect data
 for _ in range(collect_steps_per_iteration):
     collect_driver.run()

 # Sample a batch of data from the buffer
 experience, _ = next(iterator)

 # Train the agent
 train_loss = agent.train(experience)

 # Log training metrics
 step = agent.train_step_counter.numpy()

 if step % 200 == 0:
     print('step = {0}: loss = {1}'.format(step, train_loss.loss))

# Evaluate the agent
def policy_eval(agent, env):
 total_return = 0.0
 for _ in range(10):
     time_step = env.reset()
     episode_return = 0.0
     while not time_step.is_last():
         action_step = agent.policy.action(time_step)
         time_step = env.step(action_step.action)
         episode_return += time_step.reward
     total_return += episode_return
 avg_return = total_return / 10
 return avg_return.numpy()[0]

evaluated_return = policy_eval(agent, env)
print('Average Return:', evaluated_return)

# Train a Mario-playing RL Agent

This implementation guides you through the basics of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). By the end, you'll develop an AI-powered Mario using Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) capable of autonomously playing the game.

## Overview

1. **Introduction to Deep RL:** Gain an understanding of the principles behind Deep Reinforcement Learning.

2. **Setting up the Environment:** Configure the game environment and necessary libraries.

3. **Implementing the Agent:** Develop an RL agent using Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN).

4. **Training the Agent:** Train the agent to play the Mario game by itself, optimizing its performance.

5. **Evaluating Performance:** Assess the agent's proficiency by observing its gameplay and analyzing metrics.

## Prerequisites

No prior knowledge of RL is necessary, but familiarity with the concepts can be beneficial. You can refer to the provided cheatsheet for quick reference.

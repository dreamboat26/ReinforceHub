# Deep Q-learning for Cart-Pole Game

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to train a neural network using Deep Q-learning to play the Cart-Pole game through reinforcement learning. In Cart-Pole, a pole is attached to a cart, and the goal is to keep the pole balanced by moving the cart left or right.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `gym`: OpenAI Gym library for providing environments for reinforcement learning.
- `numpy`: Library for numerical operations.
- `tensorflow`: TensorFlow library for building and training neural networks.
- `matplotlib`: Library for data visualization.

You can install the dependencies using pip

# Game Environment

The Cart-Pole game environment provides the following observations:

- Cart position (x): [-2.4, 2.4]
- Cart velocity (dx/dt): [-inf, inf]
- Pole angle (θ): [-41.8°, 41.8°]
- Pole angular velocity (dθ/dt): [-inf, inf]

The agent can take the following actions:

- Move left
- Move right

The goal is to balance the pole for as long as possible.

# Deep Q-learning

Deep Q-learning involves training a neural network (Q-network) to approximate the Q-values of state-action pairs. The Q-values represent the expected future rewards for taking an action in a given state. The agent learns to choose actions that maximize the cumulative future rewards.

# Training Process

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the Q-network with random weights.
2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** During training, the agent balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions based on learned Q-values).
3. **Action Selection:** Choose an action using an ε-greedy policy, where ε is the exploration rate.
4. **Observation and Reward:** Observe the next state and reward after taking the chosen action.
5. **Experience Replay:** Store experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in a replay buffer.
6. **Update Q-values:** Sample mini-batches of experiences from the replay buffer and update the Q-network using the Bellman equation.
7. **Training Iterations:** Repeat steps 3-6 for multiple training iterations.

# Evaluation

After training, the agent's performance is evaluated by running episodes in the game environment using the learned Q-network. The goal is to achieve a high average reward over multiple episodes.
